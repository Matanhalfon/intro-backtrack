i disscused the ex with:
Gal Bazia, omri yavne ,eran gilad

=============================== Description:
1)in the first part of the ex we create a naiv function that can solve 
all kind of placing problam. by backtreck :for every empeaty spot that need placing cheaks 
for every given vule if that a legal move by the game rules and if so call it recursivly for the 
next emepty spot , the bace case is if we maneded to fill all the emepty spots , else it return false which
make the function to undo the last palcing if all vules dont make it into a solution so the function return False
2)the second part make the genral_backtreck function solve a suduko game 
i created a function that retrun if the a placing of a number in a cord is a
legal move or not and a function that read the sukdko file and return a dict of every cord and 
the value the sudku takes in any part of it (0 represents for emepty space).
after that we make all the the needed parmeters for the genral_backtrack function and then
input that to the function 
3)the map coloring problam , 
in which we needed to solve the map coloring problam by the genral_backtrek
I created a function that checkes if the palceing of a cereten color for a country is legal (means no anther nieghbor  country have
that color already) if so the return True and if  not return False.
and i created a function that read the adj file and translate it into a dict with key it a country and the vules are the
neighbors country to it .
then i placed all the right parmeters for the genral back treck means a sorted list of countryes by the num of there neighbors
a dict of country and the color placed in them a set of colors to paint with and the legal fucntion from before. 
4)--improving backtek-
i attepted all kind of wayes to make the bakctreck less bruteforce and more smrat.
a)the sort all the countrys by num of there neighbors
b)to start by countries with smallest poossbel colors 
i created a new back trek for thet way of sort in which the function dont go ahed by 1 for the index but
it use a function that checks by a dict of all the possbiltes for each country is the one with the minimall 
opptions for placeing, and run by it , in that back treck the bace case is that the dict to vales dont contians any vules of None(not painted country)
c)in that function i  created a function thet return if placeing the color in that place
is also legal for all the neighbors country mean it wont create a sitution in which any of the niebor country dont have any more possbels 
colors.
a then place that country to the parameters of the backtrek function.
d)i tried to choose the Least Constraining color so i creat a dict in which every country have all the left options for placeing .
for every time i place a color in one country i remove that color form the posbeltis of all the neighboring countrys .
if the function needs to go back and uncolor a country so it use a function that update the dict of posseble vule .
